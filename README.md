# Krat OS

Krat OS is a small RISC-V OS kernel written in Rust. 

Currently targets the RV64GC ISA, and the QEMU virt machine. May support other RISC V boards in the future, as well as real physical devices.  

## Installation

Cargo, as well as qemu RISC-V are required. 

May create an ISO image in the future.

Will update this later...


## Usage
